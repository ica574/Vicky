Hey Vicky... What do you do?

 With the power of AI, Vicky understands your questions and replies back!
 However, Vicky lives on the Polygon blockchain. All software used is hosted on IPFS and can be analysed and also improved. 
 One could create an app for himself as well as other Vicky users to use. This is also hosted on IPFS and can be done through an in-app form.
 Vicky is also distributed through Valist to ensure it's decentralized ecosystem. 

 Some of these apps are token gated. The user must purchase License NFTs through our in-app store or through the Valist marketplace or Sapphire Launcher.
